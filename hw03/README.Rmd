## Hi! You are seeing the folder containing Assignment 3 for my STAT545 homework.

This assignment was not only uploaded in the .Rmd and .html formats that you can see within the folder, you may also view it as a webpage [here](link).

### Relevant information

+ [STAT545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) is a data analysis course at UBC, and this folder was created in the STAT545 school year **2019-2020**. 

+ For participation files (worksheets completed during class meetings), you can see my [participation repo.](https://github.com/sciclic/STAT545-participation)
